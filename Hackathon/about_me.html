        Let me introduce myself, name is Zubryov, Eddy Zubryov. Born and raised
        in Ukraine (not going to talk a lot about the current situation, its
        bad, friends and family members lost.)
        <br />
        For the past 15 years been living in The Netherlands. Started out as a
        mechanical engineer, CNC Machining, metal worker. Realised that there is
        so much more i can learn in a different field, the futuristic field,
        information technology. The ever evolving technology sparked a new
        interest in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a social and hardworking individual, with a sprinkle of
        <strong>perfectionism</strong> syndrome. If i'm working on something, i
        <strong>HAVE</strong> to make it perfect. Basically everything that i
        make from designing a product for PHILIPS, or for a Medical Company in
        Amsterdam, i'll make it perfect and worthwhile for the client.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's time to channel the same energy into the IT world.
        <br />
        I'm super eager to learn all there is about Web Development, both front-
        and end- developments. Who knows, maybe it'll spark yet another interest
        in Web Design, Software Development, AI, Cyber Security... Sky is the
        limit.
